        future. Become its predecessor. There is an absolute shortage of IT
        engineers in the world. This is despite the fact that the IT industry is
        expanding day by day, and the number of young people who want to pursue
        careers is increasing. Why? The answer is simple. It's because "good
        education" doesn't reach. Of course, we need excellent human resources
        who can acquire power on their own, but only a handful can do it. If you
        just leave it to them, you will eventually get exhausted. Business
        Engineer College "LITTLE HEROES" In order to overcome this situation, we
        have continued to research "good education" and created this system by
        generously pouring our experience and achievements up until now. From
        inexperienced people who want to become engineers, to experienced people

        to acquire knowledge as an education. As a place where everyone can
        continue to learn without difficulty, and as a place to train small
        future heroes. Now, an unparalleled trial will start.
